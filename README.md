# Customer Retention Strategy and Predictive Modeling

This project involves analyzing the Telecom Churn Customer dataset to enhance customer retention strategies. The analysis was performed using Power BI, with a focus on visualizing churn patterns and developing predictive models.

## Skills
- Data Modeling
- Machine Learning
- Power BI

## Report Sections

1. **Churned Customer Analysis**:
   - Analyzed churned customers from the dataset.
   - Provided visualizations to identify trends and patterns in churned customer behavior.

2. **Customer Overall Analysis**:
   - Conducted analysis on the entire customer dataset.
   - Presented findings with visualizations to understand overall customer dynamics.

3. **Not Churn Customer Risk Analysis**:
   - Analyzed non-churned customers to identify potential future risks.
   - Created machine learning models (including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost) to predict risky customers.
   - Applied oversampling techniques and tuned hyperparameters to improve model performance, achieving a 17% increase in F1 score (to 0.83).

4. **Q & A**:
   - Included an interactive Q&A section for users to explore the data and insights further.
